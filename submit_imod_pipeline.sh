# 08/09/2024 - So far this is only functional for IMOD recontruction with serieswatcher and batchruntomo
# TODO: 
#   1. Incorporate each dataset into a SQL database
#   2. Provide functionality with Warp
#   3. For the IMOD pipeline, allow for splitting datasets into half sets for denoising models (i.e. cryo-CARE)


# RUN FROM YOUR PROJECT DIRECTORY! Chances are, if starting a project, this directory should be empty
# Usage:
#   Fill out the parameters in the first section, below, then save
#   Run with: sh submit_imod_pipeline.sh

# 1. Script will first copy over all the raw frames from the Glacios PC, as this is a read-only filesystem
# 2. Copy all frames to a subdiretory called Frames (if collected in Tomography 5. If collected in serialEM, frames will already by in a subdirectory). 
# 3. Rename all the mdoc files according the serialEM/IMOD convention if collected in Tomography 5
# 4. Modify the mdoc files (in place) with the correct, user-specified tilt axis if collected in Thermo Tomography 5 instead of serialEM
#     - Thermo Tomography 5 and serialEM have different conventions for recording the tilt axis. 
#     - serialEM is the de facto standard in the field. Here, we are using Tomography 5. The conversion between the two tilt axis numbers are:
#         serialEM tilt axis = -90 - Tomo 5 tilt axis
#         - i.e. if the recorded Tomo 5 tilt axis is -87, then the serialEM tilt axis is -90 - -87 = -3
# 5. Run framewatcher to perform motion correction of frames and output a tiltseries made of motion corrected frames 
#       - This process runs the IMOD alignframes program. Cannot be submitted with nohup
#       - Optional normalized dose weighting of frames
# 6. Run serieswatcher at the same time via a python script db_reconstruct.py, to watch for motion corrected tilt series to run automated reconstruction
# 7. Transfer to the database upon completion of tomogram reconstruction via a python script db_reconstruct.py
